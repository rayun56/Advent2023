# Rayun - Advent of Code 2023

My plan for this year's advent of code is to choose a programming language at random for each day, and do the advent using that.
The languages in the pool are:

- Python (The comfort zone)
- C (Classic)
- Java (The standard)
- JavaScript (Punishment)
- Rust (New beginnings)
- MIPS Assembly (Pain)

Below is a log of my progress.

## Day 1 ([day1.py](python/day1.py))
> [!NOTE]
> Language rolled: Python

Fairly straightforward. My initial plan for part 2 did not work out, so instead I had to go with an uglier solution that gets the job done.

## Day 2 ([day2.py](java/src/day2.java))
> [!NOTE]
> Language rolled: Java

Java's scanner is actually not too bad for string parsing, this went pretty smoothly.
